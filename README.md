# learning-projects

**Where I store the code I write when learning new things**

This repository is meant as a catch-all for the code I write both freely and from exercises when learning new languages, frameworks and the like.
Ongoing projeccts will stay in an independent branch until they're ready to be merged to `main` when they're finished.
