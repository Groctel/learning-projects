# Rust + tcod roguelike

**A port of the Complete Roguelike Tutorial, using python+libtcod.**

This project gathers the code from [Tomas Sedovic's tutorial](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/index.html).

## Progress report

### Part 1 - Graphics

#### What I did

I created a basic tcod program with a graphic setup and some input control.

#### What I learnt

This has been my first contact with Rust, so there has been a lot to be learnt.
I've used `cargo` to fetch some dependencies and build my project and learnt about Rust's memory ownership mechanics and the `match` block, which are wicked sick!
