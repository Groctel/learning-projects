# Exercise 24

**More Practice**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex24.py
```

## What I did

I printed some text with different ways of formatting it and returned multiple values from functions.

## What I learnt

When returning multiple values from functions, these values are stored in an array, which can be unpacked by assigning multiple variables to it in one line or dereferencing it and letting Python assign every value to a different element of a format string (for example, I'm sure there are many more uses).
