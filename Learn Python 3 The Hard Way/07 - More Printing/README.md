# Exercise 07

**More Printing**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex7.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some formatted strings and created a big string by concatenating smaller strings.
I also changed the `end` character of a `print` string from a linefeed to `' '`.

## What I learnt

Strings can use the `*` operator to create a string that is equal to itself concatenated `n` times as well as the `+` operator to concatente themselves with other strings.
