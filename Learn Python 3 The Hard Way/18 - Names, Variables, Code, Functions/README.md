# Exercise 18

**Names, Variables, Code, Functions**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex18.py
```

## What I did

I defined four functions using the `def name(args):` syntaxis and called them after their definitions.

## What I learnt

Python needs to know the functions' definitions before calling them.
These functions' arguments can be passed as an arbitrary size array (`*args`), but that's only useful for some special cases (something like C's `printf` arguments).
