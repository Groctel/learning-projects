# Exercise 35

**Branches and Functions**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex35.py
```

## What I did

I wrote a very simple text adventure that used calls to different functions to simulate the rooms and had a very simple parser.

## What I learnt

When evaluating strings, you can search for the regex `^.*(substring).*$` with the `if "substring" in string` syntax.
The `sys.exit` module terminates the program with the return value passed as an argument.
