# Exercise 19

**Functions and Variables**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex19.py
```

## What I did

I defined a function that takes two arguments (which I kindly treated as numbers with no type checking techniques) and called it in many different ways.

## What I learnt

Since only one element is passed per argument, operations can be defined in the functions' arguments and their results will be what's passed.
