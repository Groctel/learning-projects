# Exercise 16

**Reading and Writing Files**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex16.py FILENAME
```

## What I did

I used the `truncate` and `write` function to respectively remove the contents of a file and add new contents to it.

## What I learnt

Without using conditionals, `^C` can be issed to a program to terminate it with an interrupt (`SIGINT`).
I also edited the `write` statement for `line2` to print the linefeed using a formatted string, which look wicked.
