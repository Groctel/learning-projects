# Exercise 39

**Dictionaries, Oh Lovely Dictionaries**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex39.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some code that stores information in dictionaries and used it to reference different data tables.

## What I learnt

Dictionaries work like databases in the way that their elements are stored in a `key:value` way and can be used to reference other dictionaries, so you could use python to create a relational database and a free ticket to the hospital.
