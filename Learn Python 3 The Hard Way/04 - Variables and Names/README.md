# Exercise 04

**Variables and Names**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex4.py
```

## What I did

I did some operations using variables and printed their results afterwards.

## What I learnt

Just like other languages, Python can print variables to `stdout`.
There's no need to add a space before and after strings, since `print` automatically accomodates it for you when printing non-string values.
I wonder how that space can be omitted?
