# Exercise 21

**Functions Can Return Something**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex21.py
```

## What I did

I defined some non-void functions and did simple arithmetic operations with their return values.
I also passed the return value of functions to other functions.

## What I learnt

As with other languages, functions can be chained together to create long one-line operations.
