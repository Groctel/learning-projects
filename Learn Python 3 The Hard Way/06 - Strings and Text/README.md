# Exercise 06

**Strings and Text**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex6.py
```

## What I did

I created `f` formatted strings, a string with a format placeholder (`{}`) and concatenated two strings (`w + e`).

## What I learnt

Python can create placeholders inside strings for `.format()` functions to substituted.
If they're not substituted, `{}` will be printed.
