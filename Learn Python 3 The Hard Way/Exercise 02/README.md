# Exercise 02

**A quick introduction to comments.**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex2.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some `print` statements like in Exercise 01, but with text preceding a `#` character, which wasn't run by Python.

## What I learned

Comments are declared by `#` in Python.
As in any other program, the comment delimiter (`#`) is ignored if inserted into a string.
