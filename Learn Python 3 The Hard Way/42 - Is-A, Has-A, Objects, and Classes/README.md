# Exercise 42

**Is-A, Has-A, Objects, and Classes**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex42.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some classes with inheritance and commented their `is-a` and `has-a` relationships.

## What I learnt

Classes can be empty by ussing the keyword `pass`.
The parent class's constructor can be called with `super()`.
