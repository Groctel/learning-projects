# Exercise 32

**Loops and Lists**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex32.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some iteration and range `for` loops.

## What I learnt

Just like in Ruby or Shell, lists can be sequentially iterated with the `for element in list` syntax.
Range loops are defined with the `range` function, which takes two arguments so that it returns a list in range `[arg1, arg2)`.
