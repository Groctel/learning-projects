# Exercise 20

**Functions and Files**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex20.py test_file.txt
```

## What I did

I defined functions that work as interfaces over file management functions and read a file line by line with `readline`.

## What I learnt

Variables can use the `+=` and similar operators, but not `++` (super sad).
