# Exercise 08

**Printing, Printing**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex8.py
```

## What I did

I create a string with four formatting placeholders and used some functions to substitute those placeholders with data.

## What I learnt

Function statements can be divided in many lines.
These lines do not need to be tabbed, but it's good practice and makes the code easier to read.
