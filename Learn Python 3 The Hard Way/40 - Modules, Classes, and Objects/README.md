# Exercise 40

**Modules, Classes, and Objects**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex40.py
```

## What I did

I wrote a class that inherited from `object` and had a very simple print method.

## What I learnt

Classes' constructors are called `__init__` in python and inheritance is defined by passing an argument to the class prototype.
When referencing attributes, `self` is mandatory.
