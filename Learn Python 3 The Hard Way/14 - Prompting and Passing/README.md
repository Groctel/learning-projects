# Exercise 14

**Prompting and Passing**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex14.py USERNAME
```

## What I did

I combined `argv` and `input` to create a program that reads an argument from the command line and then asks personalised questions based on that argument (the user's name).

## What I learnt

Program arguments can be used to add some flavour to the program's execution.
