# Exercise 09

**Printing, Printing, Printing**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex9.py
```

## What I did

I created a string with the linefeed escape character (`\n`) and I used a multi-line `print` statement with a `"""` string.

## What I learnt

Escape characters can be added to strings.
I wonder what other escape characters are there in Python?
Also, multi-line strings are enclosed between `"""` and the position of the trailing `"""` matters, since it determines where the end of the string linefeed is put (note how this program ends with an aditional blank line).
