# Exercise 38

**Doing Things to Lists**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex38.py
```

## What I did

I wrote a simple list of strings and used some of the buil-in list functions to manipulate it.

## What I learnt

When creating class functions, they must take `self` as the first argument because python evaluates `object.fn(args)` as `fn(object, args)`.
