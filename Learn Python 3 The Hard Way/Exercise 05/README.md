# Exercise 05

**More Variables and Printing**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex5.py
```

## What I did

I used `print` with the `f` (*format*) flag to print formatted strings in such a way that variables are added into them enclosed by `{}`.

## What I learnt

Formatted strings work like Ruby's `#{var}` syntax and can be a more concise to add variable values to strings, letting you remove the space before the variable's value.
