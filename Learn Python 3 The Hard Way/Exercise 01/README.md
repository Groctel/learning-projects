# Exercise 01

**A quick introduction to printing text to `stdout`.**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex1.py
```

## What I did

I wrote some `print` statements line by line and had them show on screen.

## What I learnt

The function `print` sends strings to `stdout`.
These strings can be defined by surrounding `"` or `'`, each able to contain the other inside them.
