# Exercise 12

**Prompting People**

## Running this program

```sh
python3 ex12.py
```

## What I did

I used the overloaded `input` function to print a string passed as an argument to it instead of using an external `print` call to prompt the user in one line, like `read -p` in Bash.

## What I learnt

Python allows overloading functions.
Yay!
