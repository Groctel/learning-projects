# Inform6

**A system for creating adventure games**

This project gathers the code from [The Inform Designer's Manual](https://inform-fiction.org/manual/download_dm4.html)'s exercises.

## Installing the compiler

Clone [its gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/inform6unix) and follow the instructions from the README.

## Installing an interpreter

I'm using `frotz`, but any Z-machine interpreter should do.
The following are available in Arch's `community` repositories:

```
3 community/frotz-sdl 2.51-1 (96.9 KiB 194.2 KiB)
    Graphical Z-machine interpreter for interactive fiction games
2 community/frotz-ncurses 2.51-1 (75.4 KiB 150.6 KiB) (Installed)
    ncurses-based Z-machine interpreter for interactive fiction games
1 community/frotz-dumb 2.51-1 (69.1 KiB 135.0 KiB)
    Z-machine interpreter for interactive fiction games, for dumb terminals or scripting
```
